# 🖥️ Backend Learnings 🚀

Welcome to my **Backend Learnings** repository — a personal archive where I document and push code from my day-to-day backend development practice.

This repo is my ongoing journey into mastering backend systems, server-side development, APIs, databases, authentication, cloud deployments, DevOps, and everything in between.
